              üñ•Ô∏è -- The Challenge of the <strong>Perfect App</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              Geeft is the project I collaborated on for my end-of-training project. Alongside my two colleagues, we developed this app within a span of two weeks.
              <br>
              I took on the role of project lead, primarily focusing on design and front-end development, although I also contributed to the back-end.
              <br>
              <br>
              It was an incredible experience that taught me a great deal about the technical aspects, project management in the tech field, and the role of a product manager in a broader sense.

        <p>After building a successful career in the commercial sector,
          I'm now looking to embark on a path that I'm truly passionate about.
          <br>
          My last 7 years of experience in SAAS enabled me to discover the world of programming up close.
          This world has always intrigued and attracted me, stimulating my curiosity and
          my desire to contribute to tech projects in a more meaningful way.
          <br>
          My Sales background has enabled me to develop serious skills in communication, project management
          and understanding customer needs. I aspire to apply these skills combined with my new tech knowledge
          to help develop innovative products that meet market needs while offering the best user experience.</p>
